# Showcase

Common showcase for libraries

## The five-minute setup.

Check your system for local requirements (run until it passes!):

    script/bootstrap

Run tests to ensure that all pass:

    npm test

Run the project locally (with tests and watcher):

    npm start

Then navigate to the [showcase](http://localhost:5000).
